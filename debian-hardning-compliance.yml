#  .---------| My "Hardning" for FleetDM Compliance completion
#  |
#  | This is a bit of a special one, yes it's hardning, but it might
#  | not contain all the normal stuff - I use this to keep my hosts
#  | inline with my compliance requirements that i have set inside
#  | FleetDM so that i don't recieve complience alerts and also to
#  | keep the hosts harden and secure of course. But it's not a
#  | "100%" total lock down.
#  | 
#  | This playbook will do the following:
#  | - Make sure SSHd only accepts root via "key"
#  |
